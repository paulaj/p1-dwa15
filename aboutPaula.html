					<h2> Who am I and what do I do?</h2>
			        <h4> I'm Paula Jacobs, a Software Engineer at Charles River Analytics. I was born and raised in south Florida but moved to Massachusettes to go to MIT for my undergrad and decided to stay after graduation. Although I miss the warm sun and the beach, I like living in a city with good public transportation, interesting people, and lots of things to do.  </h4>

				    <h2> Why am I taking this course?</h2>
			        <h4> I have a few reasons! First, I wanted to expand my web programming knowledge. I'm pretty good with front end web development, but I've only ever had one class that taught any backend, and that was with Rails. I saw that this class was working with a few web technologies I haven't used before and was focused on PHP, which I really don't have much experience with, and it seemed like a good idea. Second, my workplace pays for some continuing education/ personal development stuff, so I wanted to utilize that benefit as soon as I could. Third, as odd as it sounds, I just kind of missed being in a classroom.   </h4>

				    <h2> What previous experience do I have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
			        <h4> A lot? Um, I guess it started back in elementary school making neopets guild pages, then I took web design as an elective in a high school summer camp, then I worked a little bit on my parents web page, then in college I had classes that used web programming ( A UI class and a Software Studio) and html/css was just a basic requirement by then.  </h4>

				    <h2> What previous experience do I have with programming?</h2>
			        <h4> A lot! I took AP Computer Science in High School and ended up going to a computer science summer camp at UCF. Before I knew it I left the state to get a Computer Science and Engineering degree and now I'm a Software Engineer!   </h4>

				    <h2> Have I worked with PHP before?</h2>
				    <h4> Not really, but I'm hoping to change that :)  </h4>

				 	<h2> Am I working on a Mac or PC?</h2>
				    <h4> PC. </h4>

				    <h2> Is there anything else you should know about me?</h2>
				    <h4> There's not much else to say. I like learning new things and strengthening areas I'm weak in. I plan on continuing to take summer/extension school courses in additon to whatever self-study I can do so that I can be the best Software Engineer I can be!  </h4>
